<h1>Attendance and Participation</h1>
<p>Every student must attend every class and participate in class activities, regardless of other obligations or their current progress in the course material. This means advanced students must engage in discussions and groupwork. It also means students who are having difficulties must still pay attention and engage with the class each day. The only exception to this policy are absences permitted according to SAMI school rules, such as absence or inability to participate due to illness or injury.</p>
<h1>Behavior</h1>
<p>This class has many students who are beginning their high school academic careers. As a consequence, this syllabus will provide you with the basic guidelines for behavior which will govern all decisions regarding inappropriate, distracting, discriminatory behavior and/or rule violations. Each student is responsible for his or her own behavior as well as the behavior of classmates. As a consequence, all misconduct should be corrected immediately by either the offending student or any other student in class by asking the offending student to correct the conduct immediately. If a student is asked by the professor to correct misconduct, then the student must do so immediately. Failure to do so will result in an escalation of the incident, which is both unnecessary and not in line of the pillars that form the basis for SAMI. If in doubt whether conduct is appropriate, consider whether the conduct is appropriate for yourself, for others, for the class, for public and consistent with the pillars of SAMI. If so, it is likely to be apropriate conduct for class.</p>
