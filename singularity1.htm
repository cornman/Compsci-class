document.write("<p>As a member of the Singularity class, you have chosen to assist a local public school to improve its boring syllabus. To flex your muscles as a new web programmer and to prove you have gained significant skills in HTML and CSS, you have decided to completely rewrite the course syllabus for CS@SAMI. It is your intention to replace the boring and ugly syllabus with a much more interesting, professional syllabus, including pictures, links and everything else a modern webpage should have!!</p>");
document.write("<p>To help you on this journey, your classmates have decided to join you and form a coding team. As a coding team, you will work together to create a multi-page website. To that end, you will be required to communicate, coordinate and cooperate! Here are the general details:</p>");
document.write("<p>Who: Groups of four students from class Singularity.</p>");
document.write("<p>What: Create a better syllabus webpage, including multiple pages, images, links to important information and your own design style.</p>");
document.write("<p>When: This project will be due in class on Wednesday, February 26, 2014. We will share and discuss our websites that day.</p>");
document.write("<p>Where: Portable 11, Science and Mathematics Institute Portables.</p>");
document.write("<p>Why: This culminating project wraps up the web programming section of the CS@SAMI course by challenging you to implement all of the skills you have gained learning to code in HTML and CSS.</p>");
document.write("<p>How: Each group will coordinate to use notepad or a similar text editting software to create an improved course syllabus.</p>");
document.write("<p>Project Goal: To demonstrate student understanding of HTML, CSS and group dynamics in a software development setting.</p>");
document.write("<p>Grading Scale: This summative assignment is graded using SAMI's B, A, M, and E letter grading system.</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>General Site Requirements: Students will create at least five (5) total web pages. One webpage will be the primary syllabus page and it will be the responsibility of the entire group. Each of the remaining four (4) webpages will be individually authored and designed by one member per webpage. It is important that the webpages designed by the individual group members be linked to and from the main page.</p>");
document.write("<p>Specific Site Requirements: All webpages created by students for this project should have, at a minimum, the following elements: Five (5) links to appropriate webpages, One (1) relevant media file (such as an image, video or sound), All appropriate HTML code (ie., all necessary tags, a title, the DOCTYPE...), a CSS page defining the style of the page which changes, at least, the font on the page and the background color (one style sheet may be shared to all pages or each page may have its own style sheet, whichever your group prefers. Keep in mind the styles should be consistent, though they may be different, across all group webpages.), All relevant information for that page (all together the pages should contain at least all of the information already contained in the syllabus), at least two accurate Meta tags for each page and, finally, the group name or the members' names if no group name exists should be visible somewhere unobtrusive on the page.</p>");
document.write("<p>Group Reporting Requirements: In addition to the website, please write one page or less (handwritten, typed and printed or typed and emailed to me) explaining the following things about your group: WHO was in your group, HOW did you communicate with one another, WHERE did you meet to make the webpage or where did you store the digital files for everyone to share if you did not meet in person, WHAT role was assigned to each groupmember, HOW did you handle conflicts and editting of your site, WHAT was the best thing about your experience with your group, WHAT could your group have improved during the creation of this site? If any group member did not participate or communicate effectively during this process, then list your efforts to communicate with that person and their responses. You will not be punished for a groupmates failure to participate, but you are expected to make every effort to incorporate every member of your group.</p>");
document.write("<p>Design Requirements: To receive full credit, your resulting website should be cohesive and have a professional appearance. Distractions from the purpose of the site, such as funny videos, images or links to irrelevant material, take away from the overall success of this sort of site and will result in a decrease in the design grade. Taken as a whole, the site should be easy to read, all links and media should be functional, and the information from the syllabus should be presented in a meaningful way to the user. Common errors in design include using very small or very large font size, fonts that are difficult to read, incorrect spelling, improper grammar, parts of the webpage appearing off-screen or in inappropriate locations, to name a few.</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>The following are optional, ungraded challenges (so called Hacker Challenges, in honor of the hacker culture that invented the internet) that students are not expected or required to complete. They are just for fun and, possibly, bragging rights among your classmates. They are not in any way required nor have I taught you the skills to accomplish any of them.</p>");
document.write("<p>Hacker Challenge Level One: Add a form to your site that takes in user input and alters the webpage in some way as a result of that input.</p>");
document.write("<p>Hacker Challenge Level Two: Add a fake login to your website that doesn't work. Then, create a backdoor (a secret entrance) that bypasses the fake login you just added.</p>");
document.write("<p>Hacker Challenge Level Three: Create an animation which shows the Singularity (a black hole) consuming the website and hide a link to it somewhere on your site.</p>");
document.write("<p>Hacker Challenge Level Four: Add login functionality to your site, including encryption of user names and passwords. Then, create a backdoor (a secret entrance) to the login functionality you just created.</p>");
document.write("<p>Hacker Challenge Master Level: Hide a minigame in the webpage which is only accessible by users visiting the website from computers on the Tacoma Public Schools' network but not from any other network. So, I would not see the minigame on my laptop at home, but would see it and be able to play it on my laptop at the school. Please include a high score system so that we special few who can see the game can compete for top honors!</p>");
