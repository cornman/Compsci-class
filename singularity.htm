document.write("<p>Dear student, you are a member of the Singularity!</p>");
document.write("<p>Professor: Kyle M. McCormick, J.D..</p>");
document.write("<p>Who: Open to all Science and Mathematics Institute students.</p>");
document.write("<p>What: This introductory computer science course will introduce students to the study of computers and computer programming, as well as the science of rigorous examination of the algorithmic and electronic bases for modern computing.</p>");
document.write("<p>When: Mondays and Wednesdays, 8:00 AM to 9:25 AM</p>");
document.write("<p>Where: Portable 11, Science and Mathematics Institute Portables.</p>");
document.write("<p>Why: To improve existing knowledge and skills in computation, or to gain a new understanding of the technology used everyday!</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>Course Learning Objectives: Students will be introduced to binary, modern hardware, the structure of the internet, ethical use of computing and the internet, computer programming (including: variables, functions, classes, loops, conditionals and input/output) and the role of technology in society.</p>");
document.write("<p>Additional Learning Opportunities: Introduction to artificial intelligence, web servers, data structures, advanced algorithms, computer graphics, computer and network security (including computer hacking, viruses, password management and other dangers and opportunities), game design and various opportunies to be determinied.</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>Material: This course is an original course for SAMI students about a topic that changes frequently. To ensure that students receive the best and most updated education, most resources utilized in the course will be free internet sites. Among the essential sites in this course will be: khanacademy.net, codecademy.com, w3schools.com, edX.org, wikipedia.org and various .gov and .edu sites.</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>Attendance and Participation: Every student must attend every class and participate in class activities, regardless of other obligations or their current progress in the course material. This means advanced students must engage in discussions and groupwork. It also means students who are having difficulties must still pay attention and engage with the class each day. The only exception to this policy are absences permitted according to SAMI school rules, such as absence or inability to participate due to illness or injury.</p>");
document.write("<p>Behavior: This class has many students who are beginning their high school academic careers. As a consequence, this syllabus will provide you with the basic guidelines for behavior which will govern all decisions regarding inappropriate, distracting, discriminatory behavior and/or rule violations.  Each student is responsible for his or her own behavior as well as the behavior of classmates. As a consequence, all misconduct should be corrected immediately by either the offending student or any other student in class by asking the offending student to correct the conduct immediately. If a student is asked by the professor to correct misconduct, then the student must do so immediately. Failure to do so will result in an escalation of the incident, which is both unnecessary and not in line of the pillars that form the basis for SAMI. If in doubt whether conduct is appropriate, consider whether the conduct is appropriate for yourself, for others, for the class, for public and consistent with the pillars of SAMI. If so, it is likely to be apropriate conduct for class.</p>");
document.write("<p>Challenge: Students in this class will vary in skill from very proficient computer programmers to beginning computer scientists. As a result, the material will be directed toward those who are learning the material for the first time. This may cause more experienced students to face difficulty being challenged and engaged throughout the course. To be challenged and grow intellectually, advanced students are expected to ask challenging questions about the material to their professor, assist learning students, engage in dynamic group activities and always seek to do more than the minimum requirements of the class. Moreover, throughout the course, advanced students will have the opportunity to learn and achieve results in Hacker Level challenges that are improvised challeneges to extend, improve or magnify course projects. These are optional requirements intended to stretch students to their maximum potential.</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>Grading System: Student scores will be based on projects, programs and activities throughout the course, as detailed below.</p>");
document.write("<p>Attendance and Participation in Daily Activities: 15%</p>");
document.write("<p>Weekly or Bi-Weekly Programs: 20%</p>");
document.write("<p>First Major Project: 20%</p>");
document.write("<p>Second Major Project: 20%</p>");
document.write("<p>Final Project: 25%</p>");
document.write("<p></p>");
document.write("<p>Disability, Accomodation and Limitation: Please notify the school administration who will notify me of any necessary accomodation for you, personally, which would be required to maximize your opportunity to learn.</p>");
document.write("<p>Technology: Throughout the course, students will be utilizing web sites and computers to accomplish course objectives. It is the responsibility of each student to gain consistent access to computer technology to facilitate completion of coursework. If no internet or computer is availabale at home, then speak with your professor for suggestions. I strongly encourage students to utilize public, school computers and public library computers, if no other computers are available to them.</p>");
