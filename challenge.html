<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>Students in this class will vary in skill from very proficient computer programmers to beginning computer scientists. As a result, the material will be directed toward those who are learning the material for the first time. This may cause more experienced students to face difficulty being challenged and engaged throughout the course. To be challenged and grow intellectually, advanced students are expected to ask challenging questions about the material to their professor, assist learning students, engage in dynamic group activities and always seek to do more than the minimum requirements of the class. Moreover, throughout the course, advanced students will have the opportunity to learn and achieve results in Hacker Level challenges that are improvised challeneges to extend, improve or magnify course projects. These are optional requirements intended to stretch students to their maximum potential.</p>
